          <p>You're busy. You've got better things to do than shop for clothing.</p>
          <p>
            We're here to help. We love to travel. The more we travel, the better it is to return back to a place of comfort and confidence.
            Exploring the unknown and meeting new people helps us grow, and the more we discover the new, the more we've learned the basics,
            even something as simple as clothing, is what knit cultures together.  And in our experiences is our life of leisure, our mental photo album, which sends us beyond.

            Sourced, sewn, and sold in the USA, our clothing is made using the best materials we could find. We use 100% long fiber combed cotton, making our
            shirts some of the highest quality and the most durable out there. Comparable shirts retail above $80, making
            Leisure of NYC one of the best values of any American Made shirt.

          <h3>OUR COMPANY</h3>
          <p>
            Back in 2011, Joe was working for an airline, and had numerous late nights trying to help passengers who had weddings,
            funerals, and important meetings the next day and only had the clothes on their back. Knowing there was nothing he could do to help, with his sister,
            Courtney, they created Leisure of NYC -- a clothing company obsessed with making sure you have the essentials you need, everywhere you go.
          </p>
          <p>
            LEISURE is in your nearest hotel.  While most hotels don&#39;t have available space for an actual retail store, we do want to make sure you&#39;re
            in clothes that make you feel at home, even when your luggage is still stuck at O&#39;Hare.  We&#39;re perfectionists, and we believe we&#39;ve made some of the
            best clothing you&#39;ll want to never leave home without.
